The total balance of any loan is made \nthe combined balance of different sub-accounts. Each sub-account can be considered as a separate pot and can be\ninterrogated separately or as a total. For Bridging loans, the following sub-accounts are available:\nsub-account A: Capital\u00a0-\u00a0The Capital sub-account holds the capital balance of the loan. It is affected by redemptions, drawdowns, interest roll up, and capitalisati\nbalance on this account is used to calculate the contract interest to be applied for that account.\nsub-account B:\u00a0 Retained Interest\u00a0- The Retained Interest sub-account holds any retained interest payments. Monthly payments are transferred from sub-accoun\nsub-account C to cover the instalment due.",

The import process involves:\n1. A\u00a0JSON\u00a0request is submitted to the Validation API.\n2. The Validation API runs two sets of rules:\na. The first set is run on the request and will reject the request if data is not complete or incorrect. For example, when mandatory request data is missing.\nb. The second set of validation is a more complex, which analyses the data contained in the request to ensure that it makes sense. For example, a request doe\ncontain a security property, which will work fine for a savings account, but will result an error for a bridging loan account request.\n3. When the request has passed all validation, the data is put into the 'Incoming' staging area. It is used to inspect the data via SQL in its raw form, before it gets tran\na Phoebus account.\n4. Once the data has been inserted, the Import API takes over. The Import API runs on a schedule and picks up any accounts in the staging area that are marked as\n'READY_TO_IMPORT'.\n5. Once an account is picked up, the Import API will run through several processing steps, where the request data is transformed into a live account on Phoebus. It a\ntriggers the workflows to create the required system diaries for the account.\nPSL provides the REST API documentation as a part of the release process to the clients. The REST documents help to\nunderstand the fields that migrated by the API and also includes the details of how the API works. Please refer to the REST\ndocuments provided as a part of the release for more accurate and up-to-date information.\nFiles:\nSample Rest Documents\nSample JSON file\nWorkflows used for Bridging loans\nYou can configure various workflows in Phoebus to manage activities that require a scheduled action or where one action l\nlogically to another or series of actions. The workflows are configurable to match your organisation's business process nee\nA few new workflows have been added and some existing workflows have been changed to manage the bridging loan\nadministration.\nW010 - Completions workflow\nThe W010- Completions workflow will be run as a part of the loan boarding process and performs the following:\nChange the first S030 (Instalment due) diary date to the loan completion date.\nSet up all the required system diaries for the bridging loans.\nCreates a diary to trigger the loan expiry check workflow (W310) 3 months prior to the loan term expiry date.\nCreates a diary to trigger the Title registration chaser workflow (W024) if the Deeds title is not registered within 56 days of\u00a0loan inception.\nCreates a W210 Loan expiry\u00a0workflow dated\u00a021 physical days\u00a0prior to\u00a0S070 diary date for bridging loans.\nGenerates the Welcome letter (L525) automatically during the system overnight routine.\nW024 - Title registration chaser workflow\nThe workflow is useful to notify the lender if the Deeds title is not registered. The\u00a0N070: Security charge record\u00a0screen can\nused to check if the value of\u00a0Security status\u00a0is\u00a0A1 Perfected\u00a0with an appropriate date in the\u00a0Date security perf.\u00a0\u00a0field.\u00a0\nAn activity follow up is created if the Deeds title has not been registered by the borrower's solicitor within 56 days of the bridging loan completion date.\nCreate a second follow up action.\nW210 Expired account workflow\nAt the '21 day pre expiry check' the workflow checks if the customer is servicing the loan and checks if the loan is a DD pay\nand if so, updates the \u2018payment method\u2019 to a non-DD method deletes any X660 DD diaries and also produce the BACS\u00a00C\u00a0D\nclosure notification file. It also \u00a0re-dates the W210 diary to run again at the loan expiry date when it will create an \u00a0F202Ter\nexpiry\u00a0\u2018follow up\u2019 action to prompt a user to make contact with the customer to discuss full repayment of the bridging loan.\nW310: Bridging pre expiry check\u00a0 workflow\nThis is a new workflow added for bridging loans and is used to trigger an automated Bridging - pre-expiry letter x months p\nterm expiry date. This is a configurable workflow parameter and is set for 3 months. However, you can change it using the A\nWorkflow Maintenance screen, if necessary.\nRuns 3 months prior to the loan expiry date to generate pre-expiry letter (L352).\nIf the payment method is DD, then the Direct Debit diary is cancelled on loan expiry date.\nThe sub-accounts structure is configurable and is aligned to match with your organisation's business process needs.\n\uf1b3",

If the CMI is being calculated in A150 instead of the usual PMT function, a straig\ninterest calculation is used for the CMI recalculation\u00a0capital balance * rate/12\u00a0for bridging loans.\nIf the selected loan is an FCA regulated bridging loan, the check for issue of a\u00a0K023 pre instalment change\u00a0letter is to be\nbypassed to enable adjustments to be made.\nRedemptions\nThe loan redemption process for bridging process is similar to the redemption of mortgages. See the Redemptions section\ndetailed procedure and field descriptions related to partial and Full redemptions.\nPartial settlement\nThe borrowers can choose to make partial settlement of their bridging loan balance at any point. The interest for bridging lo\nusually charged at the agreed rate from the date of completion till the end of the period of partial settlement. If a settlemen\ndone part way through an interest period,\u00a0a full period's interest will be applied regardless of the settlement date.\nFor bridging loans, no partial settlement letters such as K002- Part redemption quote to third-party, K004-Part redemption\nconfirmation and K005-Part redemption quote to customer will not be produced. The CMI will be re-calculated at the time \nsettlement and takes effect at the end of the period in which the transaction takes place.\u00a0Instead of the usual PMT function\nstraight interest calculation is used for the CMI recalculation\u00a0capital balance * rate/12\u00a0for bridging loans.\nFull settlement\nWhen generating a full settlement quote for bridging loans, a full month\u2019s interest is applied regardless of the settlement dat\nthis controlled using a configuration setting. But, for the roll up bridging loans, the interest will be applied up to the settleme\ndate similar to the current functionality for 1st/2nd charge loans. The actual date when the account is redeemed can be ide\nfrom the transactions posted at the time of redemption.\nThe roll up bridging loans are on a different account type (040001) and use daily interest rest for period interest and if the E\nmethod has Permitted settlement date is set to I - interest application date, then the users can only select the interest date \nA228: Full settlement screen.\nLetters and Reports\nMost of the letters that are sent as a part of bridging loan administration are similar to the letters sent as a part of mortgage\nadministration. The letters have been updated to include revised wording and sections relevant for bridging loans.\nFor example, The\u00a0Welcome\u00a0letter has been changed to include the sections and details of the bridging loan.\nLetter code &\ndescription\nDescription\nWhat triggers the letter generation\nL081\nChange of address\nletter\nN077 (Letters to customers)\nL234\nChange of name\nN077 (Letters to customers)\nK133\nDD set up\nconfirmation\nN060 (Payment details screen)\nL580\nBase rate change\nBase rate change (for LIBOR rate changes)\nK003\nFull redemption 3rd\nparty\n\u00a0A228 Full Redemption\nK006\nFull redemption\nCustomer\nA228 Full Redemption\nAny deferred interest calculation will be performed outside of Phoebus system.\n\uf1b3\nIf you change the interest margin rate, a letter must be manually generated to notify the customer about the change.\nIf you wish to extend a loan term, it must be done before S070 (Loan term expiry) diary runs.\nA150 checks for the stage of the account (CLAD045) and will not allow you to make any changes if the stage is n\nN-Normal.
